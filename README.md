# Usage
Run the python script via CMD or the batch file and select the folder containing your ZZZ textures (PNG/TGA). It will create a folder called 'Converted' with the new textures/VMTs. Note that the VMTs are configured for my own usage, so you may need to alter the format for your own needs/setup

# Notes
- To get the full effect, use my Dynamic ENV Map mod so you don't have fullbright cubemaps
- What I assume is early-build textures for ZZZ, these rare occurences don't work with the script and will be converted incorrectly. I will look into detecting these later on
