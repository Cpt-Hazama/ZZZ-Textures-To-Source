# Usage
Copy your extracted textures into the scripts directory and run the batch file. It will create a folder called 'Converted' with the new textures/VMTs. Note that the VMTs are configured for my own usage, so you may need to alter the format for your own needs/setup

# Notes
- To get the full effect, use my Dynamic ENV Map mod so you don't have fullbright cubemaps
- What I assume is early-build textures for ZZZ, these rare occurences don't work with the script and will be converted incorrectly. I will look into detecting these later on
